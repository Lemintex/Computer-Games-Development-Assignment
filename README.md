# Gravity Dude (CSCU9N6 Project)

Gravity Dude is a 2D platforming game I made for a university assignment. We were given the basic game engine as a starting point and were tasked with making a fun game with features we had learned about.

### Some things I am proud of in this implementation:
-supports multiple layers of tile maps so grass can be rendered in front of tiles (this can be expanded)
-full support for sprite editing via tilemap
-neat multi-stage collision system for sprite to sprite contact, including directional detection to further enhance enemy mechanics
-easily expandable level and parralax system

I recieved 100% for his, although in my opinion it can be improved.
