# Computer Games Development Assignment
## What is this?
This (Gravity Dude) is a university assignment where I was tasked with making a 2D game. I was given the basic game engine as a starting point and was tasked with making a fun game with features we had learned about.

## Some things I am proud of in this implementation
This is far from perfect, but at the time I was very pleased with the final product I produced. I was particularly happy with features that went far beyond the basic scope of the task, such as:
- tilemap system that supports multiple layers so layers could be rendered in front of others to add things like grass or rocks (this system is expandable with minimal code changes)
- full support for sprite adding and positioning via tilemap
- neat multi-stage collision system for sprite to sprite contact, including directional detection to further enhance enemy mechanics
- easily expandable level and parralax scrolling system, with variable map width and height

## What mark did you get for this?
For this assignment I scored 100% which felt incredibly rewarding.
